# AI Video Lab

This repository is an experimental lab for **AI-generated video**  
used in **education, technical presentations, and research materials**.

The focus is **not on visual spectacle**, but on:

- reproducible prompt design
- stable and inspectable workflows
- avoiding technical and conceptual inaccuracies

AI-generated video here is treated as a **supporting visual layer**,  
never as a primary source of information.

---

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

- explore how AI-generated video can be **safely integrated** into educational contexts
- document prompts and workflows that **preserve technical correctness**
- explicitly define what *should* and *should not* be animated

The emphasis is on **risk reduction**, not expressive freedom.

---

## Basic Policy

- Videos are short (typically **5–15 seconds**)
- No equations, no numbers, and no critical symbols in motion
- No readable text or data-bearing elements
- AI video is used only for:
  - introductions
  - atmosphere setting
  - conceptual or abstract background

If visual motion risks misinterpretation, the video must be discarded.

## Repository Structure

```
ai-video-lab/
├─ prompts/ # Reproducible prompt patterns
├─ workflows/ # Generation and post-processing workflows
├─ samples/ # Minimal input/output examples
└─ notes/ # Pitfalls, failures, and quality checks
```


Each directory is designed to support **reproducibility and review**,  
not artistic iteration.

## Intended Use Cases

- Lecture or course introductions
- Research presentation openings
- Conceptual framing before static diagrams or equations

AI video is intended to **precede** accurate content,  
never to replace it.

---

## Non-Goals

This repository explicitly does **not** aim to support:

- full-length or narrative videos
- animated equations or precision-dependent schematics
- demonstrations where numerical accuracy is implied
- tool-specific tutorials without generalizable methodology

If a use case cannot be generalized, it does not belong here.

---

## Philosophy

AI-generated video is treated as **visual context**, not as truth.

All accuracy must originate from:
- static figures
- diagrams
- equations
- spoken or written explanation

When in doubt, **do not animate**.

This conservative stance is intentional and central to the design of this lab.
