# AI Video Lab

This repository is an experimental lab for **AI-generated video**  
used in **education, technical presentations, and research materials**.

The focus is **not on flashy videos**, but on:
- reproducible prompts
- stable workflows
- avoiding technical inaccuracies

---

## Purpose

- Explore how AI video can be safely used in educational materials
- Record prompts and workflows that do **not break technical correctness**
- Clarify what *should* and *should not* be animated

---

## Basic Policy

- Videos are short (typically **5–15 seconds**)
- No equations, no numbers, no critical symbols in motion
- AI videos are used only for:
  - introduction
  - atmosphere
  - conceptual background

## Repository Structure

```
ai-video-lab/
├─ prompts/      # Reproducible text prompts
├─ workflows/    # Generation and editing workflows
├─ samples/      # Minimal input/output examples
└─ notes/        # Pitfalls, failures, and quality checks
```

## Intended Use Cases

- Lecture introductions
- Research presentation openings
- Conceptual explanation before static diagrams

---

## Non-Goals

- Full-length videos
- Animated equations or precise schematics
- Tool-specific tutorials without generalization

---

## Philosophy

AI video is treated as **visual context**, not as a source of truth.
Accuracy always comes from static figures and explanations.
