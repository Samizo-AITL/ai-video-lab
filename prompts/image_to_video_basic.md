# Image to Video – Basic Pattern

## Purpose
Animate a **static technical image** without breaking accuracy.

Used for:
- schematic diagrams
- block diagrams
- conceptual figures

---

## Input Image Requirements

- Clean background
- No small text
- No equations
- High contrast shapes

---

## Prompt (Image to Video)

```
Slow and minimal camera movement,
slight parallax effect,
gentle zoom in,
keep original structure unchanged,
no new elements, no text, no symbols
```

---

## Expected Output

- Duration: 5–10 seconds
- Motion: very subtle
- Structure: identical to input image

---

## Common Failures

- Added fake symbols
- Warped geometry
- Excessive motion

---

## Rule

If the structure changes, discard the video.
